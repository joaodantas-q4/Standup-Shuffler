# Standup-Shuffler
I created this site with the intention to follow the Q4 style guide and create some kind of gamification.

Order of speakers: 
1 - IM/IC
2 - Dev/Content/QA

Every time start button is clicked, all the names are shuffled.
I added a function to return to the previous speaker, to prevent the person who is using it from getting lost in the order.
There's a Restart button that restarts all the process
